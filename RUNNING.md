# Running SPRFST from a terminal

You downloaded the project. Here is every command, in order, with what
each one prints. Nothing here needs the disk image.

Written for macOS. It works the same on Linux; where the two differ, it
says so.

Two things about copying commands out of here. None of these blocks
contain comments, because zsh — the Mac's shell — treats a `#` on a
command line as an argument, not a comment, and answers `too many
arguments`. And when a block has several lines, paste them one at a
time, so you see each answer before the next command runs.

---

## 1. Get the tools

SPRFST is built with a C compiler and `make`, both of which come with
Apple's command line tools. If you have never installed them:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Check you have them:

```
cc --version
make --version
```

If `cc` answers, you are ready. (On Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential`.)

---

## 2. Get the project

The work is on the branch `arena/01a1082b-sprfst-beta`, not on `main`,
so both ways below name it.

### With git, if you want to pull later updates

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone --branch arena/01a1082b-sprfst-beta https://github.com/FellowPythonCoder/SPRFST-Beta.git
cd SPRFST-Beta
```

That folder is a real checkout. To pick up later fixes:

```
git pull
```

If `git pull` complains that you have local changes, either keep them
aside and pull:

```
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

or throw yours away and take what is on the branch:

```
git reset --hard origin/arena/01a1082b-sprfst-beta
```

If git says `fatal: not a git repository`, you downloaded a zip rather
than cloning; use the zip steps below instead.

### Without git, as a zip

```
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L -o sprfst.zip https://github.com/FellowPythonCoder/SPRFST-Beta/archive/refs/heads/arena/01a1082b-sprfst-beta.zip
unzip -q sprfst.zip
cd SPRFST-Beta-arena-01a1082b-sprfst-beta
```

A zip has no history, so "updating" means downloading it again. Delete
the old folder first, or you will end up with two.

### Either way, check you are in the right place

```
ls
```

```
Makefile   README.md  RUNNING.md  assets  compiler  docs
examples   guidebook  ide         std     tests     tools
```

If you see `Makefile` in that list, you are in the project folder. If
instead you see one folder name, go into it first — unzipping sometimes
makes a folder inside a folder.

---

## 3. Build the compiler

```
make
```

About ten seconds. The last line is:

```
  ✓ built build/bin/sprfst  (Darwin/arm64)
```

That one file, `build/bin/sprfst`, is the whole toolchain: compiler,
runtime, debugger, formatter, test runner, package manager and the
service SPRFST Studio talks to.

---

## 4. Run your first program

```
./build/bin/sprfst run examples/01-hello.spf
```

```
hello, world
```

The compiler finds its standard library by looking next to itself, so
this works from any folder, with no environment variables to set.

Try a few more:

```
./build/bin/sprfst run examples/06-collections.spf
./build/bin/sprfst run examples/11-errors.spf
./build/bin/sprfst run examples/21-neural-network.spf
```

All twenty one are in `examples/`:

```
ls examples
```

---

## 5. Put `sprfst` on your PATH (optional, recommended)

So you can type `sprfst` anywhere instead of `./build/bin/sprfst`:

```
sudo make install
```

That copies two things:

```
/usr/local/bin/sprfst
/usr/local/lib/sprfst/std
```

Check it:

```
cd ~
sprfst --version
```

```
sprfst 0.1.0-beta (Ember)
```

To remove it again:

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/sprfst /usr/local/lib/sprfst
```

The rest of this guide writes `sprfst`. If you skipped this step, write
`./build/bin/sprfst` instead, from inside the project folder.

---

## 6. Start your own project

```
cd ~
sprfst new hello
cd hello
sprfst run .
```

```
hello from hello
the numbers add up to 31
```

`sprfst new` writes three files:

```
hello/project.sprfst     name, version, entry point
hello/src/main.spf       your program
hello/.gitignore
```

Open `src/main.spf` in any editor, change it, and `sprfst run .` again.

---

## 7. The commands

```
sprfst help
```

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `sprfst run <file>` | compile and run a file |
| `sprfst run .` | compile and run the project in this folder |
| `sprfst check .` | type check, print nothing if it is fine |
| `sprfst test` | run every `tests/*.spf` in the project |
| `sprfst fmt .` | format the source in place |
| `sprfst fmt --check .` | fail instead of rewriting; for a pre-commit hook |
| `sprfst lint .` | style and clarity warnings |
| `sprfst build .` | write `build/program.spir` |
| `sprfst docs .` | write Markdown documentation to `docs/` |
| `sprfst debug <file>` | run under the debugger |
| `sprfst new <name>` | start a project |
| `sprfst add --path=../lib` | add a package with Forge |
| `sprfst install` | fetch everything `project.sprfst` lists |
| `sprfst clean` | delete `build/` |

Options that work with all of them:

```
-O0 -O1 -O2 -O3      how hard to optimise (run defaults to -O1, build to -O2)
--time               print parse, check, lower and run timings
--ir                 print the instruction listing
--json               machine readable diagnostics, for editors
--quiet  --no-color  --version
--                   everything after this goes to the program, as sys.args()
```

For example:

```
sprfst run --time examples/01-hello.spf
```

```
  1 file   parse 0.0ms  check 0.0ms  lower 0.0ms  run 0.0ms  5 instr  0 KB peak  0 gc
hello, world
```

---

## 8. The interesting examples

**A window, in the terminal.** The GUI framework draws to a real window
on a Mac and to the terminal everywhere else. Force the terminal
version with `SPRFST_UI=term`:

```
SPRFST_UI=term sprfst run examples/18-gui-counter.spf
```

```
  SPRFST Counter
  ------------------------------------------
  Count is 0
  ----------------------------
  [1] Add 1
  [2] Take 1
  ...
  press a number to act, q to quit
  >
```

Press `1`, then `q` to leave.

**A web server.**

```
sprfst run examples/19-web-server.spf
```

```
serving http://localhost:8080  (ctrl-c to stop)
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> in a browser, or in another terminal:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Stop it with `ctrl-c`.

**A database.**

```
sprfst run examples/14-database.spf
```

**A neural network, trained from scratch.**

```
sprfst run examples/21-neural-network.spf
```

---

## 9. The debugger

```
sprfst debug examples/05-functions.spf
```

At the `(debug)` prompt:

```
b 15            break at line 15
b 15 if n > 3   break only when the condition holds
r               run
n               next line, over calls
s               step into a call
o               step out
c               continue
v               variables here
k               call stack
p name          print one value
w expr          watch an expression
m               memory
l               list breakpoints
d 0             delete breakpoint 0
?               help
q               quit
```

A whole session, start to finish:

```
sprfst debug examples/05-functions.spf
(debug) b 15
  break 0 at line 15
(debug) r
  breakpoint  05-functions.spf:15  in main
    14  fn main() {
    15 >     io.say("2 + 3 = {add(2, 3)}")
(debug) v
  double           nil
  total            nil
(debug) k
  ▸ 1  main  05-functions.spf:15
    0  <start>  05-functions.spf:28
(debug) c
2 + 3 = 5
(debug) q
```

Quitting with `q` exits with status 1 and says `stopped by the
debugger`. That is normal — it means the program did not run to the end.

---

## 10. SPRFST Studio — the app

Studio is a real native Mac application, not a window with a website in
it. Three commands build it, put it in `/Applications` and open it, and
after that you never need the terminal again.

```
cd ~/Downloads/SPRFST-Beta
git pull
make studio
```

That is `./tools/build_macos_app.sh --install` underneath: it builds the
compiler, runs the test suite, checks the Swift, draws the icons, writes
`Info.plist`, compiles the editor for `arm64-apple-macos12.0`, signs it,
copies it to `/Applications`, removes the quarantine flag, registers it
with the Finder and launches it.

From then on, open it like any other app:

- Launchpad, or
- Spotlight — `⌘Space`, type `SPRFST`, or
- the Dock — right click its icon, Options, Keep in Dock, or
- double click any `.spf` file: they carry the SPRFST icon and open in
  Studio.

Everything the language can do is inside the app. There is a real shell
in the bottom panel if you ever want one, but running, building,
testing, debugging, formatting and the guidebook are all buttons and
keys:

`⌘P` command palette, `⌘R` run, `⌘B` build, `⌘U` test, `⌘D` debug,
`⌘\` toggle breakpoint, `⌃⌘F` format, `⌃⌘J` go to definition,
`⌃⌘E` rename, `⇧⌘O` open folder, `` ⌃` `` terminal, `⌘0` guidebook,
`⌘1` `⌘2` `⌘3` hide or show the explorer, the inspector and the
bottom panel, `⌘+` and `⌘-` text size.

The three regions are dragged by the lines between them. The right
hand side is one inspector with four tabs — problems, outline, git and
the debugger — rather than four panels fighting over the same column.

All of the chrome is set in a handwriting face, which is the point of
the thing. If you want your code in it as well, open Settings with
`⌘,` and choose **SPRFST Hand**; **Clean Code** keeps code monospaced
and is the default.

The app carries its own copy of the compiler, the standard library, the
examples and the guidebook inside the bundle, so it works even if
`sprfst` is not installed anywhere else on the machine.

To rebuild after a change, run `make studio` again — it quits the
running copy, replaces it and reopens it.

**Be honest with yourself about this step.** Studio's 3,300 lines of
Swift were written on Linux, where `swiftc` does not exist, so the first
build on a Mac is their first real compile. `tools/check_swift.sh`
checks brackets, selectors, AppKit initialisers and the entry point
before `swiftc` runs, but it is not a compiler. If `swiftc` prints
errors, they are printed in full — send them over. None of this affects
the language itself: sections 1 to 9 are tested on every change.

Other ways to run the same script:

```
./tools/build_macos_app.sh
```

builds `dist/SPRFST Studio.app` without installing it, and

```
./tools/build_macos_app.sh --skip-tests
```

builds even if the test suite fails, while

```
./tools/build_macos_app.sh --stage
```

lays the bundle out on a machine with no Swift, to inspect it.

For a disk image you can hand to someone else:

```
./tools/make_dmg.sh
open dist/SPRFST-0.1.0-beta.dmg
```

---

## 11. The `make` targets

```
make              build the compiler
make test         the whole test suite, 54 checks
make docs         regenerate docs/
make guidebook    compile every code block in the guidebook
make pdf          typeset guidebook/pdf — 30 chapters and the book
make studio       build the editor, install it in /Applications
                  and open it                   (needs a Mac)
make app          dist/SPRFST Studio.app        (needs a Mac)
make dmg          dist/SPRFST-0.1.0-beta.dmg
make stage        lay out the app and image contents without building them
make install      /usr/local/bin + /usr/local/lib   (needs sudo)
make clean        delete build/
```

Run the tests on your own copy — it is the fastest way to know the
download is sound:

```
make test
```

```
  54 passed, 0 failed  3s
```

---

## 12. Learning the language

Thirty chapters, every example runnable:

```
open guidebook/pdf/SPRFST-Guidebook.pdf      the whole book
ls guidebook/pdf                             one PDF per chapter
ls guidebook                                 the same thing in Markdown
```

Every code block in those chapters is compiled by the test suite, so
nothing in them is out of date.

---

## 13. When something goes wrong

**`sprfst: command not found`** — you have not run `sudo make install`,
or `/usr/local/bin` is not on your PATH. Use `./build/bin/sprfst` from
the project folder, or add this to `~/.zshrc`:

```
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

**`Cannot read <file>`** — the path is wrong. `ls examples` and copy a
name exactly; they are numbered `01-` to `21-`.

**`cannot find module std.io`** — the compiler cannot see its standard
library. It looks next to its own binary, then in
`/usr/local/lib/sprfst`. Point it somewhere explicitly if you have
moved things:

```
SPRFST_HOME=/path/to/SPRFST-Beta sprfst run myfile.spf
```

**A build that fails after you edited the C sources** — object files can
go stale:

```
make clean && make
```

**macOS refuses to open something you downloaded** — right click it and
choose Open, instead of double clicking it.

**`cd: too many arguments`** — you pasted a line with a `#` comment on
it. zsh does not take comments on the command line. Paste the command
only.

**`zsh: no such file or directory: ./build/bin/sprfst`** — `make` has
not run yet, or it ran somewhere else. `ls` should show `Makefile`; if
it does, run `make` and watch for the line that ends `✓ built`.

**`error tests failed — not packaging a broken build`** — the packaging
script will not wrap a toolchain that does not pass its own tests. See
exactly what broke:

```
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

**One test fails and the rest pass** — tell me which line, and paste
it. Two have been fixed that way already: `timeout` not existing on
macOS, and the PNG check using `grep` on binary data, which BSD grep
refuses to match in a UTF-8 locale. Both were faults in the tests, not
in what they were testing.

**`sprfst debug` exits with 1** — that is what quitting the debugger
does. Nothing is wrong.

## The two minute version

```
git clone --branch arena/01a1082b-sprfst-beta https://github.com/FellowPythonCoder/SPRFST-Beta.git
cd SPRFST-Beta
make
./build/bin/sprfst run examples/01-hello.spf
sudo make install
sprfst new myapp
cd myapp
sprfst run .
```

And the editor, as an app in `/Applications`:

```
cd ~/Downloads/SPRFST-Beta
make studio
```
