SPRFST Browser $VERSION

Drag "SPRFST Browser" on to the Applications folder.

WHAT IT IS
A browser whose engine is written in SPRFST: the address parser, the
HTML parser, the style engine, the layout engine and the blocker are
all SPRFST source, inside the app at Contents/Resources/engine. The
window is AppKit, and it only paints what the engine hands it.

THE FIRST TIME
macOS will say the developer cannot be verified, because the app is
signed with an ad hoc signature rather than a paid certificate. Right
click it in Applications and choose Open, once.

WHAT IT BLOCKS
$(grep -cvE '^\s*(~~|!|$)' "$ROOT/browser/rules/shield.rules" | tr -d ' ') rules, in Contents/Resources/engine/shield.rules. It is a
plain text file; edit it and reopen the browser. sprfst://shield shows
what was stopped on the page you are reading.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
There is no JavaScript engine, so pages that build themselves in the
browser arrive empty, and anything behind a script will not work. It
is honest about this rather than pretending: no scripts are fetched at
all, which is also why it is quick.

SPRFST Browser $VERSION

A web browser whose engine is written in SPRFST — the language in this
same image. Nine modules in "SPRFST Browser $VERSION/browser/src":

    uri.spf      addresses, and what a typed line means
    html.spf     the parser: tags, attributes, entities, bad markup
    css.spf      selectors, declarations, colours, lengths
    shield.spf   the blocker and its rule format
    layout.spf   lines, blocks, lists, images — a display list
    fetch.spf    HTTP over a socket, with a small store
    reader.spf   the Lens: find the article, drop the furniture
    page.spf     one trip: address in, laid out page out
    main.spf     the terminal view, and the service the window drives

WHAT THIS IS NOT
It is not a prebuilt application. The image was produced on Linux,
where Apple's Swift compiler, AppKit and hdiutil do not exist, so no
macOS binary could be put inside it. Rather than ship an app bundle
with nothing in it, the image ships the source and a builder.

TO INSTALL
Double click "Install SPRFST Browser.command". It copies the project
to ~/SPRFST-Browser, builds the interpreter, runs the engine's tests,
then builds "SPRFST Browser.app" and puts it in /Applications. It
needs the Xcode command line tools:

    xcode-select --install

If macOS refuses to open the installer because it came from the
internet, right click it and choose Open, or run it yourself:

    bash "/Volumes/SPRFST Browser/Install SPRFST Browser.command"

BEFORE YOU BUILD ANYTHING
The engine reads pages on its own, in a terminal:

    cd ~/SPRFST-Browser && make
    cd browser && ../build/bin/sprfst run src/main.spf -- example.com
    ../build/bin/sprfst run src/main.spf -- --reader en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser

WHAT IT BLOCKS
$RULES rules in browser/rules/shield.rules, a plain text file you can
edit. Adverts, trackers, consent walls, chat widgets, cryptominers.
Nothing is sent to Google, including the search: DuckDuckGo's plain
HTML endpoint is the default, and it is one line in sprfst://settings.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
There is no JavaScript engine. Pages that build themselves in the
browser arrive empty. No script is fetched or run, which is also why
pages that do work are quick: a four kilobyte article is read, styled
and laid out in about six milliseconds.
