# SPRFST Studio

Studio is the editor that comes with the language. It is a native Mac
application — AppKit, Apple Silicon, no web view anywhere — and it
drives the same `sprfst` toolchain you have been using from the
terminal. Everything it shows you comes from the compiler, so the
editor can never disagree with the build.

## The window

```

Deep black behind, near black panels, warm orange for anything that
matters, soft white text. Nothing blinks and nothing bounces.

## Shortcuts worth knowing

| Keys | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘P` | command palette — every command, and every symbol in the file |
| `⌘R` | run the project |
| `⌘B` | build |
| `⌘U` | run the tests |
| `⌘D` | start the debugger |
| `⌘\` | toggle a breakpoint on this line |
| `⌃⌘F` | format the file |
| `⌃⌘J` | go to definition |
| `⌃⌘E` | rename everywhere |
| `⇧⌘O` | open a folder |
| `⇧⌘N` | new project |
| `⌃\`` | focus the terminal |
| `⌘0` | open this guidebook inside Studio |

## The panels

**Explorer** is the project tree. **Problems** lists every error and
warning the compiler reported, with the code (`E0201`), the message and
the position; clicking one jumps there. **Outline** lists the modules,
types, functions and tests in the current file. **Git** shows the
branch, the changed files and a diff, and can stage and commit.
**Debugger** has the breakpoint list, the call stack, the variables and
the watches, driven by the same engine as `sprfst debug`.

## The bottom strip

**Terminal** is a real shell in the project folder — `sprfst`, `git`,
anything. **Run** shows a program's output with its exit code, run time
and peak memory. **Playground** runs the current file every time you
stop typing and reports the output, the first error, the time it took
and the memory it used, which makes it a fast way to try an idea
without saving anything.

## The editor

Syntax highlighting comes from the compiler's own lexer through the
`tokens` request, so a new keyword is coloured the day it exists.
Completion, hover and go-to-definition all ask the toolchain as well:

| Behaviour | Request behind it |
| --- | --- |
| autocomplete | `complete <file> <offset>` |
| hover documentation | `hover <file> <offset>` |
| go to definition | `define <file> <offset>` |
| rename | `rename <file> <offset>` |
| format on save | `format <file>` |
| problems | `check <file>` |
| outline | `outline <file>` |

There is a minimap, a breakpoint gutter you can click, inline error
marks, and bracket and indentation handling that understands SPRFST
blocks.

## Fonts

Studio ships four choices, in Settings:

- **SPRFST Hand** — the handwriting face used for the brand, for
  headings and for the welcome screen, with a readable code face for
  the code itself
- **Clean Code** — the same code face everywhere
- **System** — the system interface font
- **Monospace** — a fixed width face throughout

Size is adjustable, and the choice is remembered between launches.

## Running the toolchain yourself

Studio finds `sprfst` in this order: inside its own bundle, then
`/usr/local/bin`, then your `PATH`. The status bar shows the version it
found. If it cannot find one, every command that needs it says so
plainly instead of failing silently.

The protocol is open — `sprfst studio` on the command line starts the
same service Studio talks to, one JSON request per line. Chapter 27
lists the requests.

## Building Studio

On a Mac with Xcode's command line tools:

```
make app        # builds build/bin/sprfst and dist/SPRFST Studio.app
make dmg        # wraps the app in dist/SPRFST-Studio.dmg
```

`tools/build_macos_app.sh` compiles the Swift sources with `swiftc`,
assembles the bundle, writes `Info.plist` with the `.spf` file
association, copies the compiler, the standard library, the examples
and this guidebook into `Contents/Resources`, and installs the icon.
`tools/make_dmg.sh` then stages the app next to a shortcut to
`/Applications` and builds a compressed, verified disk image with
`hdiutil`.

Both scripts need macOS: `swiftc`, AppKit and `hdiutil` exist nowhere
else. The compiler, the standard library, the examples and the
guidebook build and run on any Unix.

## Exercise

Open this repository in Studio, press `⌘P`, type `guide`, and read
chapter one from inside the editor. Then put a breakpoint in
`examples/05-functions.spf` and press `⌘D`.
