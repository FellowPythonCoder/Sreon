# Windows

A desktop program in SPRFST is an `app`. You describe what the window
contains and what each control does; the runtime keeps the two in step.

## The whole shape of an app

```sprfst
app "Counter" {
    var count = 0
    var step = 1

    window {
        title: "SPRFST Counter"
        width: 420
        height: 280

        title "Count is {count}"
        divider
        button "Add {step}" {
            on click {
                count = count + step
            }
        }
        button "Bigger steps" {
            on click {
                step = step * 2
            }
        }
        button "Reset" {
            on click {
                count = 0
                step = 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Three things are going on.

- `var count = 0` inside the `app` is **state**. It lives as long as the
  window does, and any part of the app may change it.
- A label with a `{hole}` in it is **bound**. When the state inside the
  hole changes, that label is redrawn — you never refresh anything by
  hand.
- `on click { … }` is ordinary SPRFST code. It can call functions, read
  files, start tasks. There is no separate event language.

## The elements

| Element | What it is | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `window` | the frame everything sits in | `title`, `width`, `height` |
| `title` / `heading` | large text | the label |
| `text` | ordinary text | the label |
| `button` | a button | `on click` |
| `field` / `input` | one line of typing | `value`, `on change` |
| `toggle` / `check` | a tick box | `value`, `on change` |
| `list` | a list of values | `items` |
| `divider` | a rule between things | — |

## Reading what the person typed

An event can carry a value. Name it in brackets after the event and it
arrives as an ordinary parameter:

```sprfst
app "Notes" {
    var draft = ""
    var notes: [Text] = []
    var pinned = false

    window {
        title: "Notes"
        width: 460
        height: 420

        title "{notes.len()} notes"
        field "New note" {
            value: draft
            on change(text) {
                draft = text
            }
        }
        button "Keep it" {
            on click {
                if draft.trim().len() > 0 {
                    notes.push(draft.trim())
                    draft = ""
                }
            }
        }
        toggle "Pin this window" {
            value: pinned
            on change(ticked) {
                pinned = ticked
            }
        }
        divider
        list {
            items: notes
        }
    }
}
```

`value: draft` sends state *into* the control, `on change(text)` brings
the answer back out. Clearing `draft` in the button handler empties the
box, because the binding runs again after every event.

## Where the window comes from

The same program runs against more than one backend, chosen with the
`SPRFST_UI` environment variable:

| Value | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| `term` | the window drawn in the terminal, with numbered controls |
| `json` | one line of JSON describing the window, then exit |
| `none` | build the window, print its description, exit |
| unset | `term` when the terminal is interactive, otherwise `none` |

On a Mac, and inside SPRFST Studio, the app is hosted in a real AppKit
window. The terminal backend exists so an interface can be driven on a
machine with no screen — which is how every window in this guidebook is
tested.

```
SPRFST_UI=term sprfst run examples/18-gui-counter.spf
```

## Building an interface by hand

`app` is sugar over `std.ui`, which you can call directly when the
interface is generated rather than written out. `ui.window` gives you a
node id, `ui.node` adds children, and `ui.on` attaches handlers.

```sprfst
use std.io
use std.ui

var clicks = 0

fn main() {
    let w = ui.window("Built by hand", 360, 200)
    let label = ui.node(w, "title", "0 clicks")
    let press = ui.node(w, "button", "Click me")

    ui.on(press, "click", fn() => {
        clicks = clicks + 1
        ui.set(label, "text", "{clicks} clicks")
    })

    ~~ `ui.emit` fires a handler from code, which is how you test an
    ~~ interface without a person pressing anything
    ui.emit(press, "click")
    ui.emit(press, "click")
    io.say("the label now says: {ui.get(label, "text")}")
    io.say("backend: {ui.backend()}")

    ui.run()
}
```

Note `var clicks` outside `main`. A closure captures the values around
it as they were, so a counter that has to survive between clicks lives
in app state or in a module level `var`, not in a local.

## Exercise

Add a "Remove last" button to the notes app, and a heading that shows
the most recent note, or `nothing yet` when the list is empty.
